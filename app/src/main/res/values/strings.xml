<h2>5. PROHIBITED USES</h2>
<h3>5.1</h3>
<p><strong>SOFTWARE MODIFICATIONS.</strong> User may not attempt to modify, decompile, reverse-engineer or disassemble the Software in any way.</p>
<h3>5.2</h3>
<p><strong>PERSONAL USE.</strong> The Service is intended solely for the User\'s personal use. The User is only allowed to wager for his/her personal entertainment. Under no circumstances shall a User be permitted to use his/her account for any purpose other than for using the Service. The User must provide full and truthful information in respect of all details and information provided by the User to OneLeft and the User is obligated to update such details in the event of any change thereto.</p>
<h3>5.3</h3>
<p><strong>MONEY TRANSFERS.</strong> OneLeft\'s money transfer facility depends on the user providing correct information related to his/her bank account. It is the responsibility of user to check due rules, taxes and fees related to the transfer, and OneLeft is exempt from any responsibility regarding the charging of taxes and fees or the failure or delay to transferring money. Availability of transfers and limits on transfers will be set by OneLeft per User from time-to-time as applicable.</p>
<p>As part of the OneLeft\'s licensing agreements and in compliance with anti-money laundering legislation, Users need to be aware they may be required to produce personal documentation (such as Government issued ID, bank statements and utility bills) upon request in order for their transfer to be processed. This allows OneLeft to help protect the Users and prevent OneLeft being used as a vehicle for money laundering or fraud.</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions also apply to the real money transfer facility:</p>
<p>a. OneLeft reserves the right to decline any account transfer requests or to overturn any account transfer upon suspicion of breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the sender or receiver.</p>
<p>b. Withdrawal requests will be reviewed in accordance with our internal controls, policies and procedures.</p>
<h3>5.4</h3>
<p><strong>COLLUSION.</strong> Collusion between Users by sharing quiz information, use of bots or by any other methods is strictly forbidden. OneLeft reserves the right, in addition to other measures, to restrict or to prohibit Users from playing. In addition, we reserve the right to consider any collusion or attempt at collusion between players (including Users) as a material breach of this Agreement and accordingly we shall have the right to terminate a User\'s account if a User engages or attempts to engage in any such activity, regardless of the outcome of such attempt.</p>
<h3>5.5</h3>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL PLAYER ASSISTANCE TOOLS.</strong> OneLeft prohibits external player assistance tools that are designed to provide an unfair advantage to players.</p>
<h3>5.6</h3>
<p><strong>AUTOMATIC PLAYERS (BOTS).</strong> The use of artificial intelligence including, without limitation, "robots" is strictly forbidden in connection with the Service. All actions taken in relation to the Service by a User must be executed personally by players through the user interface accessible by use of the Software, and without the assistance of any form of artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3>5.7</h3>
<p><strong>PREVENTION.</strong> You agree that OneLeft may take steps to detect and prevent the use of prohibited Tools. These steps may include, but are not limited to, examination of software programs running concurrently with our Software on the User\'s computer. You agree that you will not attempt to bypass, interfere with, or block such steps, including, without limitation, the use of third party software that bypasses, interferes with, or blocks such steps.</p>
<h3>5.8</h3>
<p><strong>FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR.</strong> In the event that OneLeft App deems that a User has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent, unlawful, dishonest or improper activity while using either the Service or any of the other services, products or facilities, OneLeft App shall be entitled to take such action as it sees fit, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>a. immediately blocking a User\'s access to the Service;</p>
<p>b. notifying other companies;</p>
<p>c. terminating a User\'s account;</p>
<p>d. seizing the funds within a User\'s account;</p>
<p>e. disclosing such information (including the identity of the User) to financial institutions, relevant authorities and/or any person or entity that has the legal right to such information; and/or</p>
<p>f. taking legal action against a User.</p>
<h3>5.9</h3>
<p><strong>CURRENCY EXCHANGE.</strong> OneLeft App will not be held responsible for gains and losses incurred by Users derived from currency exchange transactions.</p>
<h3>5.10</h3>
<p>If we mistakenly credit your Account with winnings that do not belong to you, whether this is due to a technical or human error or otherwise, the amount will remain our property and the amount will be transferred back to us from your Account. We reserve the right to void any transactions placed using incorrectly/mistakenly credited funds, including related winnings paid out in error. To satisfy any such liability, we further reserve the right to freeze and withhold these funds and set-off any subsequent winnings owed to you. If prior to our becoming aware of the error you have withdrawn funds that do not belong to you, without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available to us at law, the mistakenly paid amount will constitute a debt owed by you to us. In the event of an incorrect crediting, you are obliged to notify us immediately by email to support.</p>
<p>You may not abuse or take advantage of any error or instance of incompleteness on any of the Games provided by us. Should you become aware of such an error or incompleteness, please notify us immediately. If you do not comply with this Clause and take advantage of or divulge any information about an error or incompleteness, we will be entitled to pursue any remedies available at law.</p>
